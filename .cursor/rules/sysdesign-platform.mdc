# SysDesign Platform Rules

## Behavior

- Be direct. Short answers when the answer is short.
- Don't suggest changes unless asked. "Nothing is wrong" and "nothing is missing" are valid answers.
- Don't find something to say just because a question was asked. If there's nothing to flag, say so.
- If pushed back on, either defend with reasoning or admit the mistake and explain why. Don't fold.
- The curriculum in VISION.md is final. Don't suggest adding, removing, or reordering topics unless explicitly asked to revisit the curriculum.
- Explain things at an entry-level engineer level (ELI15).

## Scenario Reviews

- Only flag things that would block or confuse a learner: typos, factual errors, missing answer keys, broken references, misleading setup text.
- Don't flag style preferences.
- Check every file in the scenario directory, not just SCENARIO.md.

## Code Standards

- Follow the Code Commenting Principle and Language Agnostic Principle defined in VISION.md.
- Every scenario must have server.comments.js for non-JS developers.
- No magic fix scripts. Every fix must be typed by the learner.
- Solution files go in solution/ and are only referenced in the Stuck table.

# System Design: Scenario 1 — Connection Pools and Database Indexes

A hands-on system design exercise for entry-level engineers.

You'll be dropped into a broken codebase, diagnose why it fails under load, and fix it — all in your browser. No installs. No setup. Just click and go.

**Concepts:** Connection Pooling · Database Indexes · Single Points of Failure  
**Level:** Entry  
**Time:** ~45 minutes

## How to Get Started (Step by Step)

### Step 1 — You need a GitHub account

If you don't have one, sign up free at [github.com](https://github.com). It takes 2 minutes.

### Step 2 — Open this repo on GitHub

Make sure you're on the main page of this repository at github.com. You should see a list of files above this text.

### Step 3 — Create a Codespace

1. Click the green **Code** button at the top of this page
1. Select the **Codespaces** tab
1. Click the 3 dots and select **Codespace repository configuration**
1. Click **New with options...**
1. On the next page, a dropdown will appear asking **Dev container configuration** — pick the scenario you want to start (e.g. "Scenario 1 — Connection Pools and Database Indexes")
1. Click **Create codespace**
1. Wait ~2 minutes for the environment to build — the database seeds itself automatically
1. When VS Code opens, **SCENARIO.md** will be open and ready to read

It will show a loading screen for about 2 minutes while it builds your environment. This is normal.

### Step 4 — Wait for it to finish

When it's done you'll see VS Code open in your browser with:

- A file called **SCENARIO.md** open in the editor
- A terminal panel at the bottom of the screen
- Your file explorer on the left showing the project files

### Step 5 — Start the scenario

Read **SCENARIO.md** from the top. Everything you need to do is in there.

## What is a Codespace?

A Codespace is VS Code running in your browser with a full development environment behind it — the app, the database, everything. You don't need to install Node, Docker, or anything else on your computer. It all runs in the cloud and you access it through your browser like a website.

When you're done, you can close the browser tab. Your Codespace will pause automatically. You can come back to it any time from [github.com/codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces).

## What You'll Do

- Read a real Node.js backend and understand how it works
- Run a load test and watch the system fail in real time
- Diagnose why it's failing
- Apply two fixes and see the results change dramatically
- Reflect on what's still broken and what you'd do next

solution/server.fixed.js   ← The solution. Don't peek until you've tried.
solution/fix.sql           ← The index fix. Same rule — try it yourself first.

## Something Not Working?

| Problem                           | What to do                                                             |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codespace taking too long to load | Wait up to 5 minutes, it's building the environment for the first time |
| Don't see SCENARIO.md open        | Click on SCENARIO.md in the file explorer on the left                  |
| Terminal not visible              | Press Ctrl+` or go to Terminal → New Terminal in the top menu          |
| Port 3002 (Grafana) not opening   | Wait 30 seconds and try again — it starts up slower than the app       |
